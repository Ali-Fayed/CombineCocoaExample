# CombineWithUIKit
an iOS example app for using Combine, Combine Data Source, Combine Cocoa with UIKit and write reactive UI with Combine Features

- [CombineCocoa][CombineCocoa]
- iOS Swift CombineCocoa is a third-party framework built on top of Apple's Swift Combine.
- It provides a set of convenience operators for using Combine with popular UI components such as buttons and text fields.
- CombineCocoa simplifies the process of binding UI elements to reactive data streams.
- The framework also includes extensions for commonly used UIKit and AppKit classes, making it easy to integrate with existing code.
- CombineCocoa is widely used in iOS app development for its ability to streamline the implementation of reactive programming patterns.
- [CombineDataSources][CombineDataSources]
- iOS Swift CombineDataSource is a third-party framework that simplifies the implementation of data sources for table and collection views using Combine.
- It provides a declarative way of defining data models and transforms them into cells or views.
- The framework eliminates the need to implement complex delegate and data source methods by using reactive programming.
- CombineDataSource also includes features like automatic diffing and section management to make working with data sources more efficient.
